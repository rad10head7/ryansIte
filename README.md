## Ryan's Site

We are looking for my brother in law Ryan Don Lewis. He was last seen or heard
from in Abilene, TX. He is a father of 2 young children and is loved and greatly
missed by his family and peers. This site is a starting point for anyone with
any information or any willingness to donate to the effort to find him.
A private investigator my prove more useful than just using the local police
alone. Thank you for any support and prayers
